#Argument Parameter Introduction
'''
Arguement vs Parameter

Semantics:

def my_func(a,b):
    # code here
In this context, a and b are called the parameters of my_func
Also note that a and v are variables, local to my_func

When we call the function:
x = 10
y = 'a'
my_func(x,y)

Here x and y are called the arguments of my_func
Also note that x and y are passed by reference
i.e., the memory addresses of x and y are passed.
